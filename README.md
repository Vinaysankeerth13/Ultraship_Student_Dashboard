## Student dashboard

- Hamburger menu with just one level sub-menu deep on a few menu items 
- Horizontal menu with few sample menu items. 
- Main content showing a beautiful grid view. For example, imagine you are showing students data in 10 columns. 
- When the user want to see the same student data, it should show in a tile view showing necessary fields only.  
- Each tile will have a bun button for additional options such as edit, flag, delete etc. 
- When a tile is clicked,  show the entire details of the record in a beautiful view.  It can be an expanded tile or a pop-up style view etc.   
- We should be able to navigate back to the tile view from this expanded view. 
- Any public API can be used to display the content on the grid/tile.
